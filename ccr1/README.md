Test runs for CCR1

@rhl requested tests at

* 40% tma movement in az/el ( 40,40,40% velocity,acceleration,jerk = 4,4,16 in az and 2,2,8 in el)
* 70% velocity/40% in acceleration, jerk (70,40,40% velocity,acceleration,jerk = 7,4,16 in az and 3.5,2,8 in el)

Current baseline is 70% tma movement

* 100% tma movement
