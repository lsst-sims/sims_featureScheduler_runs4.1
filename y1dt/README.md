increasing the year 1 downtime to see how bad it gets before things break


Running the selfcal simulation on year 1, looks like some of the dusty plane doesn;t get any coverage if we drop the amount of time too low, but the selfcal still converges pretty easily on the sky that is covered and everything is well connected. The gaps are small and not critical for linking.

Note selfcal doesn't seem to have u-band, so it's still expected that calibrating u will be pretty tough.
